# gender-prediction-based-on-name

Predicting the gender of a person from their name has attracted the attention of many linguists. Various methods have been used, such as LSTM and Machine Learning. This research uses LSTM to learn sequential patterns in names and gender characteristics.

A new technique for encoding character-level and word-level from names, using embedding techniques, is also used.

🫱🏻In this task, we modified the program by adding:

- [x] a new dataset of approximately 19 thousand
- [x] word embedding in the LSTM & Word2Vec training program code
- [x] a GUI with streamlit.

With pleasure, please try our application on Streamlit via the following link:

Please contact the developer for any shortcomings or problems, we are happy to receive feedback💫
